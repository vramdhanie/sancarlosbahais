The Baha'i community of San Carlos recently gathered to commemorate the Birth of the Báb, one of the most sacred occasions in the Baha'i calendar.
Community members came together for an evening celebration that included prayers and devotional readings, followed by a shared dinner and fellowship.

## The Báb
The Báb, whose title means "the Gate" in Arabic, was born in 1819 in Shiraz, Persia. He is revered by Baha'is as the herald and forerunner of Bahá’u’lláh, the founder of the Baha'i Faith. The Báb's mission was to prepare humanity for the coming of Bahá’u’lláh and to announce the dawn of a new spiritual age. His teachings emphasized spiritual and social transformation, calling for justice, equality, and the advancement of society.

## The Birth of the Báb
The Birth of the Bab is observed on the first day of the eighth month of the Baha'i calendar. This coincides with 21 October in the Gregorian calendar. This day is celebrated by Baha'i communities worldwide with devotional programs and gatherings.

## How to get involved
The San Carlos Baha'i community regularly hosts devotional gatherings and study circles that are open to all. For more information about the Baha'i Faith or community activities in San Carlos, interested residents are welcome to reach out to the local Baha'i community.
