The Baha'i community of San Carlos gathered recently to commemorate the Birthday of Baha'u'llah, the founder of the Baha'i Faith, in an intimate celebration at a community member's home.
Thirteen Baha'is came together for the observance, which included prayers and devotional readings, stories about Baha'u'llah's life and teachings, and a shared lunch that provided time for fellowship and conversation.

## The Holy Day
The Birthday of Baha'u'llah is one of the holiest days in the Baha'i calendar, marking the birth of Baha'u'llah in 1817 in Tehran, Persia. Baha'is around the world celebrate this day with devotional programs and community gatherings.
