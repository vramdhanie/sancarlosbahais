The Baha'i community of San Carlos has been reaching out to neighbors through a booth at the San Carlos Farmer's Market, appearing once in September and again in October.

<br>
The booth featured informational posters and materials highlighting the community-building activities that Baha'is organize locally. Volunteers were on hand to answer questions and discuss how these activities bring people together across diverse backgrounds.

<br>
There were several interesting conversations with people who stopped by. People were curious about what the Baha'is do and how their activities strengthen community bonds.

## Community Building Process
The Baha'i community-building process focuses on spiritual education for children, groups for young people to develop their capabilities, devotional gatherings open to all, and study circles that explore principles for building a better society.

## November Plans
The booth will return to the San Carlos Farmer's Market in November, offering another opportunity for residents to learn more about these grassroots efforts to strengthen community life.
